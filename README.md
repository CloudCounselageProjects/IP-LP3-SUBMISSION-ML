1. There is dataset of colors named as "colors".<br/>
2. "internship.ipynb" is the source code of the project.<br/>
3. At first the RGB values are extracted from the color images and stored in the csv file called "values.csv".<br/>
4. Then the maximum pixel value between RGB is stored in the csv file called "labels.csv".<br/>
5. SVM model is used for training and testing of the dataset. The two files above are given input to the model.<br/>
6. A function called "testdata()" is created to predict the dominant color of the image.<br/>
7. The input given to the function to test the color is "input_image.png".<br/>
