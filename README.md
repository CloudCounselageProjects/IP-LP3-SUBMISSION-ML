<b><h2>Colour Prediction.ipynb</h2> </b>
<br>Notebook python code written to detect the colour of the image.
<br>
<b><h2>CSV FILE:</h2></b> 
<br>The dataset consist of 747 predefined colour names along with their corresponding RGB Value.
<br>
<b><h2>Model used:</h2></b> 
<br>Support Vector Classifier is used to predict the colour of the image. 
The methodology used is to generate the RGB colour values of the testing image and based on the RGB values prediction is done.
<br>
<b><h2>Advantages to use this method: </h2></b>
<br>1) Saves memory, instead of collecting every single image of a colour. Using RGB values makes it easier to detect.
<br>2) Less computation time
<br>3) Easy to use
